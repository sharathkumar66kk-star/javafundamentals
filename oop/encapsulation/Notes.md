## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal data and allowing access through methods.

## How it is achieved
- Declare class fields as private
- Provide public getter and setter methods

## Why encapsulation is important
- Protects data from unauthorized access
- Allows validation before setting values
- Makes code easier to maintain and modify

## Key rule
Fields should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
