## switch Statement
The switch statement selects one execution path from multiple options.

## How it works
- The switch expression is evaluated once
- Matching case is executed
- break prevents fall-through
- default runs if no case matches

## When to use
- When comparing one variable against many fixed values
- 
## Important rule
Without break, execution continues to the next case (fall-through).
