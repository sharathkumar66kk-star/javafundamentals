## if-else Statement
The if-else statement is used to make decisions based on conditions.

## How it works
- if condition is checked first
- if it is true, that block runs
- else if is checked when previous condition is false
- else runs when none of the conditions are true

## Key point
Only one block executes in an if-else chain.
