## for Loop
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

## Structure
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // loop body
}

## How it works
- Initialization runs once
- Condition is checked before every iteration
- Loop body executes if condition is true
- Update runs after each iteration
