## do-while Loop
The do-while loop executes the loop body at least once, even if the condition is false.

## How it works
- Loop body executes first
- Condition is checked after execution
- Loop repeats if condition is true

## Key difference
Unlike for and while loops, do-while guarantees one execution.
