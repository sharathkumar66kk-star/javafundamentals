## while Loop
The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not fixed in advance.

## How it works
- Condition is checked before every iteration
- Loop body executes only if condition is true
- If condition is false initially, loop body will not execute

## Key point
Initialization happens before the loop and update happens inside the loop.
